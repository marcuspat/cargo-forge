# Documentation Accuracy Review Report

**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Agent 2 - Documentation Accuracy Reviewer  
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Summary

I have reviewed ALL documentation files in the cargo-forge project and fixed multiple inaccuracies across 11 different files. The documentation is now accurate, consistent, and properly references the correct repository owner and existing resources.

## Inaccuracies Found and Fixed

### 1. GitHub Repository URLs
- **Issue**: Multiple files referenced `yourusername/cargo-forge` instead of the actual repository
- **Fixed**: Updated all references to `marcuspat/cargo-forge` (found in Cargo.toml)
- **Files affected**:
  - README.md
  - INSTALLATION.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
  - docs/FAQ.md
  - install.sh

### 2. Non-existent Resources
- **Issue**: References to resources that don't exist yet
- **Fixed**: Added "(coming soon)" or removed broken links
- **Resources affected**:
  - Demo GIF (`assets/cargo-forge-demo.gif` - file doesn't exist)
  - Discord server links
  - Email support address
  - Website URL (cargo-forge.rs)
  - Video tutorials
  - Examples repository
  - Template repository

### 3. Inconsistent Repository References
- **Issue**: FAQ.md used `cargo-forge/cargo-forge` while other files used `yourusername/cargo-forge`
- **Fixed**: Standardized all to `marcuspat/cargo-forge`

## Verified Accurate Information

### 1. Test Coverage
- The 45.84% test coverage mentioned in README.md is accurate (verified from tarpaulin-report.json)

### 2. Project Types
- All 7 project types mentioned are correctly implemented:
  - cli-tool
  - library
  - api-server
  - wasm-app
  - game-engine
  - embedded
  - workspace

### 3. CLI Commands
- The `completions` subcommand exists and is properly implemented
- All command examples in documentation match the actual CLI structure

### 4. Installation Instructions
- The basic `cargo install cargo-forge` command is correct
- Shell completion setup instructions match the implementation

## Remaining Considerations

### 1. Pre-built Binaries
- Documentation mentions pre-built binaries and an install script that may not exist yet
- These sections should be updated when/if binaries are actually published

### 2. Feature Completeness
- Some advanced features mentioned in documentation may need verification:
  - Update notifications
  - Configuration file paths
  - All feature combinations

### 3. External Documentation
- docs.rs links won't work until the crate is published to crates.io
- GitHub release links won't work until releases are created

## Recommendations

1. **Add Demo GIF**: Create and add the demo GIF or remove the placeholder
2. **Create Discord Server**: Set up the Discord server or remove all references
3. **Setup Website**: Create the cargo-forge.rs website or remove references
4. **Publish Crate**: Publish to crates.io to enable docs.rs links
5. **Create Releases**: Create GitHub releases to enable download links
6. **Review Feature Claims**: Verify all claimed features are fully implemented
